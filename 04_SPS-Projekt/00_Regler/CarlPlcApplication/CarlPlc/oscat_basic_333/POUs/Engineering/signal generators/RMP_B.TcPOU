version 2.0	23. oct. 2008
programmer 	oscat
tested BY	oscat

this ramp generator generates a byte wide ramp with 255 steps
the generator has an asynchronous set and reset
the ramp is controlled by PT which is the total ramp time for a full sweep from 0..255
an UD input controlls the direction Up or Down and the E input enables the ramp generation
a busy output indicates that the ramp is running, busy false means output is stable.
the outputs low and high will be true when the output has reached its max or min value.

(* revision history

hm 5.10.2006	rev 1.1
	added busy output
hm 17.1.2007	rev 1.2
	renamed input ud to up for better usability
	deleted unused variable step

hm	17.9.2007		rev 1.3
	replaced time() with t_plc_ms() for compatibility reasons

hm	28. sep 2007	rev 1.4
	added outputs on and off
	busy is now disabled while en is false
	new coding for higher accuracy and performance

hm	5. oct 2007	rev 1.5
	added statements to allow for PT to be t#0s output jumps to max or min immediately

hm	25. dec 2007	rev 1.6
	improved code for better performance

hm	16. oct. 2008	rev 1.7
	improved code for better performance

hm	18. oct. 2008	rev 1.8
	added type conversion to avoid warnings
	changed input en to e for compatibility reasons

hm	23. oct. 2008	REV 	2.0
