this functions returns TRUE IF dst TIME is active 
the FUNCTION calculates automatically for any year betweek 1970 AND 2099 
wheather daylight savings is on OR off 
the summertime calculation is done according to european standards.
dst will become TRUE AT 01:00 utc in the morning FOR the respective days 
AND it will become FALSE after daylight savings TIME is switched back end OF october at 01:00 utc

Equation used TO calculate the beginning OF European Summer TIME:
Sunday (31 - (5*y/4 + 4) mod 7) March at 01.00 UTC
(valid through 2099, courtesy of Robert H. van Gent, EC).

European Summer Time ends (clocks go back) at 01.00 UTC on

    * 29 October 2006
    * 28 October 2007
